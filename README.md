**Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?**

-Artemis Financial is a fianancial company. Their idea was to modernize their software by incorperating the most up to date software and security solutions.


**What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?**

-Identifying security vulnerabilities, and implementing desired software solutions. It is important to code securly as we want to mitigate threats. The more secure the more people will want to utilize and be apart of.


**What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?**

-Working through the vulnerability assesment was a little tedious but thankfully alot of it is automated and its just a matter of sorting through all the information to make the correct desision on the matter.


**How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?**

-The first approach is to understand which type of industry the company will take part in. For different applications such as finance would be more prone to threats and attacks. The more value the more it would potentially be targeted. Taking these things in to account we can decide the amount of security layers needed.


**How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?**

-Making sure the code compiles and runs properly. You can run dependency checks before and after code refactoring to ensure we didnt introduce anything into new the mix.



**What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?**

-Dependency check was a big one that can really help to identify potential issues to mitigate.


**Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?**

- In our last assignment for instance I could show my ability to understand the companies requierments, my assessment of their needs, along with how I approached their security vulnerabilities and then how I Implemented proper solutions.
